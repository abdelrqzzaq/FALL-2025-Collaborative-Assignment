                <h2>About Claude</h2>
                <p>Claude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic. Designed to be helpful, honest,
                    and harmless, Claude focuses on safety and steerability. It is known for its large context window,
                    allowing it to process entire books or large codebases in a single prompt, and for its natural,
                    nuanced conversation style.</p>
